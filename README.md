# Todo App

This is a **Todo List Application** built with **JavaScript**, which allows users to create, update, delete, and manage their tasks efficiently. It also includes features for marking tasks as completed, searching tasks, and handling notifications.

## Features

1. **Create, Delete, and Update a Task:**

   - Users can create a new task, delete existing tasks, and update the descriptions of their tasks.

2. **Mark Task as Completed or Uncompleted:**

   - Users can mark a task as completed by checking a checkbox next to the task.
   - Tasks can be marked as uncompleted if they are unchecked.

3. **Search Tasks Using Debounce:**

   - A search bar allows users to filter tasks based on their description.
   - The search functionality uses **debounce** to handle rapid input and avoid unnecessary re-renders.

4. **Notification Handling:**
   - Notifications will be shown to the user when a task is added, updated, or deleted.
